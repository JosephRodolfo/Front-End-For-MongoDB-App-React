# React Front End for Task Manager App

This is a front end to interact with the Node.js Task Manager Rest client I built with a Udemy course.

 It uses React and recommended v6 react-router authentication patterns. I also used React Context. I learned a lot building out the entire API and then how a site would interact with it, really got to learn about the fetch API, and I began to think more about what is best computed server-side vs. client-side. I also got to practice and think about lifecycle methods and how they relate to server calls.

 It was also a challenge in development using two different ports and getting them to communicate on the same local host. But in the process, I learned a lot about CORS and headers and setting them both at a high level and more specifically via middleware in Express.
