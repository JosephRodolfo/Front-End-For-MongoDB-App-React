# React Front End for Task Manager App

This is a front end to interact with the Node.js Task Manager Rest client I built with a Udemy course. It uses React and recommended v6 react-router authentication patterns as well as react-context, which was new to me. I learned a lot building out the entire API and then how a site would interact with it, and I began to think about what is best computed server-side vs. client-side.
