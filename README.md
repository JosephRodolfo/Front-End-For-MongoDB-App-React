# React Front End for Task Manager App

Deployed here: https://josephrodolfo.github.io/Front-End-For-MongoDB-App-React/

This is a front end to interact with the Node.js Task Manager Rest client I built with a Udemy course.

 It uses React and recommended v6 react-router authentication patterns. I also used React Context. I learned a lot building out the entire API and then how a site would interact with it, really got to learn about the fetch API, and I began to think more about what is best computed server-side vs. client-side. I also got to practice and think about lifecycle methods and how they relate to server calls.


 I also tried to recreate some of the testing I had done in other tutorials using Enyzme by just using React Testing Library and without Enyzme, trying to use the React Testing Library's philosophy of testing what the user sees rather than internal state (or at least my understanding of it for now). I didn't test everything (some things I quickly realized weren't written in a way as to be super testable, a problem I will remedy in the future from what I learned here but was instructive itself), but a few things to try out important concepts I wanted to practice. 
  
Finally, I got it working and communicating with the REST API hosted on Heroku, which you can try at the Github Pages like above. There's still some remaining challenges like client side validation, actually alerting users to errors outside of the console, doing some more batching of API calls, and so on.
